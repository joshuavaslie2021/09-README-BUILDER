## DESCRIPTION

This week's homework we were tasked with writing jscript outside of the console - using node.js to run a script off the web. The application needed to take in input provided by the developer, to dynamically create a README.md file in a clean, organized format.

## INSTALLATION

Since the application is off the console, in order to run the local machine must have node.js installed, as well as inquirer npm. Links to both are provided.

[!Inquirer NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

[!Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## USAGE

My intended usage for the project, to represent a clean work example for employers, was to go above and beyond to create a script that will be useful for all of my future developments. I completed the project using synchronous as well as asynchronous functions - with async being the default and most complete js (index.js contains async). The prompts retrieve all necessary input to complete a readme to 100%.
